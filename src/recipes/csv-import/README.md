# csv-import

A drop-zone CSV importer: parse, type-check, preview, emit the good rows.
Dependency-free — the parser is hand-written, not a wrapper around a package.

## Files

| File | What |
|---|---|
| `parse.js` | Dependency-free CSV parser. Text in, `{ rows, errors }` out. Never throws. |
| `coerce.js` | Maps raw string rows to typed objects given a column spec (`{ col: 'string' \| 'number' \| 'date' }`). Bad rows are reported, not defaulted. |
| `CsvImport.jsx` | Drop zone + file picker. Parses, previews the first 10 good rows, lists per-row errors, emits the rest via `onImport`. |
| `parse.test.mjs` | `node --test` coverage of every parser edge case. |

## Using it

```bash
cp -r src/recipes/csv-import src/lib/csv-import
```

Then in a page or another component:

```jsx
import CsvImport from '../lib/csv-import/CsvImport.jsx'
import { db } from '../lib/db.js'

const columns = { name: 'string', qty: 'number', when: 'date' }

async function handleImport(rows) {
  for (const row of rows) await db.insert('items', row)
}

function ImportScreen() {
  return <CsvImport columns={columns} onImport={handleImport} />
}
```

Omit `columns` entirely and every header becomes an unvalidated string column
— useful for a first look at a file before you've decided on types.

`coerce.js`'s `'date'` type returns real `Date` objects, not strings. If
you're inserting straight into `db.js`, either convert with
`row.when.toISOString()` before calling `db.insert`, or store as `'string'`
in the column spec and parse it yourself later — Postgres/Supabase will
happily take an ISO string, `localStorage` needs one either way since
`JSON.stringify` can't round-trip a `Date`.

## The 3 gotchas

1. **`columns` keys must exactly match the CSV header text**, including
   case and whitespace. `"Qty "` in the file and `qty` in your spec is a
   silent 100%-failure row for that column, reported once per row, not a
   crash — check the error list before assuming the file is empty of good
   data. If the export has inconsistent header casing, normalize
   `headerRow` before building your spec rather than fighting the source file.

2. **Rows are reported by data-row number (1 = first row after the header),
   not by file line number.** A quoted field with an embedded newline makes
   those two numbers diverge — row 3 might start on line 5 of the raw file.
   Parser-level errors (from `parse.js`) are labeled `Line N`; coercion
   errors (from `coerce.js`) are labeled `Row N`. If you need exact file
   line numbers for coercion errors too, the mapping to do it yourself is:
   `parseCsv(text).rows` in order, header at index 0, so data row `i` lines
   up with `rows[i + 1]`.

3. **A blank line in the file is not skipped — it parses as one row with a
   single empty-string field**, same as `"".split(',')`. If the export has
   trailing blank rows (common from Excel), they'll show up as failed rows
   under every non-optional column rather than being silently ignored. Filter
   them out before calling `coerce()` if that's not what you want:
   `dataRows.filter(r => r.some(field => field !== ''))`.

## Gotcha: re-imports double-count

The recipe appends every valid row on every upload — importing the same file
twice doubles the data, silently. The 27 Aug drill shipped exactly that and the
judges docked it. If the night's bullet involves repeat imports, derive an
idempotency key per row (e.g. hash of the source line, or `ngo+item+qty+eta`)
and skip rows whose key already exists — five lines that turn a silent
double-count into a visible "3 rows skipped (already imported)".
